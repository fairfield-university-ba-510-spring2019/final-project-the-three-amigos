### Database Project BA510 - Jonathan Uy, Angus Hastings, and David Sacco ###

Steps that we took to complete the project:

1. [Creating the Database](./CourseDataETL.ipynb)
2. [Testing the Database](./CourseDataTests.ipynb)
3. [Creating our Data Warehouse](./CourseDataWarehouseDemo.ipynb)
4. [Testing our Data Warehouse](./CourseDataWareHouse.ipynb)

Here is our Data Dictionary: [Click Here](./CourseDataDictionary.md)

The steps that we took to create the database and the data ware house was to first import the csv files through the terminal, then create the tables in the database and insert the csv data into them.

Next, we tested the integrity of the database by running some queries on it that we would later run on the data warehouse to make sure that we can still get the same information.

Then we created the data warehouse from the database and pulled data from the database to populate that table.

Then we ran the same queries on the data warehouse that we used on the database.
