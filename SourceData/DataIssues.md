### Academic Calendars ###
- "Fall ASAP Session II": Why does it have the date range when it starts? I would assume that it should say on Oct. 29th that it starts (along with other info) and then the last day, Dec. 14, it says that it ends. Just a thought, not an issue. (I assume that the dates on the 'Academic Calendars are sorted by start dates', what if a student is planning on traveling and looks for the end dates, and sees nothing there when something is supposed to be there? Such as final exams, I would personally look at the end of the semester, but it is not listed as the last thing on the calendar. Just another thought.)
